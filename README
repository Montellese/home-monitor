Home Monitor
============
Home Monitor is a tool design to run on a Raspberry Pi which will constantly
monitor a configurable list of boxes (based on their IP addresses) to see if
they are online or offline. If all boxes are offline the configurable server
is automatically turned off through SSH. If any one of the boxes is online the
server is automatically turned on using Wake-on-LAN.

How to build
------------
First you need to install all necessary build tools:
  # sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool
Then you need to install all the necessary dependencies:
  # sudo apt-get install libssh-dev libpoco-dev liblog4cxx-dev libpcap-dev

Then you need to build and install additional dependencies:
  # cd lib
  # make
  # sudo make install

Then you can finally build home-monitor
  # make

And install it
  # sudo make install

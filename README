Home Monitor
============
Home Monitor is a tool design to run on a Raspberry Pi which will constantly
monitor a configurable list of boxes (based on their IP addresses) to see if
they are online or offline. If all boxes are offline the configurable server
is automatically turned off through SSH. If any one of the boxes is online the
server is automatically turned on using Wake-on-LAN.

How to build
------------
Firt make sure all submodules are properly checked out:
  # git submodule update --init

Now you need to install all necessary build tools:
  # sudo apt-get install build-essential
  # sudo apt-get install curl zip unzip tar
  # sudo apt-get install bison libbison-dev flex
Then you need to install all the necessary dependencies:
  # ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics

Then you can finally build home-monitor
  # cmake -B build -S .
  # cmake --build build

And install it
  # sudo cmake --install build
